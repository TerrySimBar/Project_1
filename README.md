### Introduction
This project uses two Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) scripts with python and appropriate software components, as well as Application Programming Interface (API) to gather weather data about preferred amenities in NYC, in order to recommend the borough that best meets speciified criteria. The project includes making API calls, creating DataFrames, computing and analyzing summary totals, creating interactive maps, and saving visualizations as outputs in a designated folder.

The project includes code features for protecting API keys.

Requirements & Dependencies
Developers are highly encouraged to set up a virtual environment to ensure proper management of dependencies.
You will need the following software components:

Python (version 3.10.9)
Pandas (version 2.0.3)
Matplotlib (version 3.7.1)
geoviews
geoviews.tile_sources  
hvplot.pandas
json
numpy
requests
os
shutil

## Analysis

- A separate script 'Api_requests.pynb' was used to make two Yelp API calls with JSON to handle and export lounge and grocery datasets as csv files to a folder named 'Resources'. Another script was used to fetch the data for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using a CSV URL and code to also export the file to the 'Resources' folder. 

- Pandas was used to read the three csv files and create respective dataframes. 

- The EVCS dataframe was wrangled to keep only specified columns, rename columns, and then add a column 'Type' to indicate the amenity-EVCS.

- The lounge dataframe added a column 'Type' to indicate the amenity-Lounge.

- The grocery dataframe added a column 'Type' to indicate the amenity-Grocery.

---
- The three dataframes were concatenated with pandas to create a stacked dataframe, and also check the dataframes features.

---
- The stacked dataframe was cleaned by dropping null/empty and duplicate values. The length of the dataframe was also checked.

---
- A specific city dataframe was created from the clean stacked dataframe to return only rows for the three preferred boroughs. The length of the specific cities dataframe was checked as well as the unique cities.

- The EV charging stations were counted by borough and a bar graph was made to visualize the results.

### Usage
Here's how to use the Jupyter Notebook NYCamenitiesPy and API_requests scripts:

- ##### Create a pyhton script to store and import API keys as aliases. 

- ##### Distribute code appropriately across Jupiter Notebook cells to display the desired output.

- ##### Run the code.
- The scripts will make API calls, organize and analyze data to display the specified elements in-line
